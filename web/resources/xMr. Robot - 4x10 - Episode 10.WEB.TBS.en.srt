1
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,612
- Alexa, are we friends?
- Yes.

2
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:10,296
She said you haven't been sleeping.

3
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,843
You need your rest.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,092
You still having them?

5
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:16,159
In this day and age,

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,016
it's sicker not having panic attacks.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,084
Fuck!

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,066
Wow. I've never touched
something so beautiful.

9
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:23,555
I feel the same way each time.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,890
Can't we just be a normal couple

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,726
that looks up vacation
packages to Budapest?

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:28,560
Just so you know...

13
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,506
Full-time freelance now.

14
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,403
Only loyalty is to the almighty paper.

15
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:35,567
I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

16
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,569
Everything you need to know is on here.

17
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,170
You can't make your own currency.

18
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,106
That is the federal government's job.

19
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,277
With Ecoin equal to $1,
we are the authority.

20
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,078
You know that night we spent together.

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,548
So this is why you came
here. You were just using me.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,287
You know it was more than that.

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,951
Well, I am not leaving you like this.

24
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,253
You wanna help me?

25
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,454
This is all my fault.

26
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,591
Take them down.

27
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,594
The data dump from fsociety was easily

28
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,164
the largest and most damning
doxxing case in history.

29
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,900
While only a small percentage
of the documents in the breach

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,770
have been substantiated at this time,

31
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:14,039
those that have are
proving to be accurate.

32
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,392
With regard to their source,

33
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,026
the intelligence community is cautioning

34
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,578
the overall veracity of the data dump

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,213
and rush to judgment, citing
fears falsified documents...

36
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,416
And then your 1K letter
to the FBI will be issued

37
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,917
by the US Attorney's office

38
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,419
once everything you've told us,

39
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,122
and what you've logged
in here, checks out.

40
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,891
Now, I do need to mention

41
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,894
these are some serious crimes
you committed, Agent DiPierro.

42
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,395
You may come out of this with a record.

43
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,597
There's not much we can do about that.

44
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,533
China's Minister of State
Security has been exposed

45
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,803
as the infamous hacker
and leader of the Dark Army

46
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,492
known only as Whiterose.

47
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,773
Intelligence officials
who have long thought

48
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,108
Whiterose's identity...

49
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,811
Those dresses he showed me.

50
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,114
Were the key to confirming
Zhang's double life.

51
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,583
He was trying to tell me who he was.

52
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,319
Saying it was the missing
link that finally allowed them

53
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,687
to connect Whiterose...

54
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,223
I'm sorry, who are you referring to?

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,327
China has yet to officially
respond to the claims...

56
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,197
Nothing.

57
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,733
In either the Deus
Group or the Dark Army.

58
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,734
As for your job at the Bureau,

59
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,712
you're on administrative
leave for six months

60
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:20,872
- until OPR does their thing.
- What's in the bag?

61
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,208
Oh. This is saline.

62
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,709
We'll be putting some medicine in there

63
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,945
- so you can get some rest.
- No.

64
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,147
No drugs. I don't want any drugs.

65
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,016
I'm gonna leave soon anyway.

66
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,159
Oh, sweetie, you can't
leave here anytime soon.

67
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:35,887
She's right, Dom. You need to stay put.

68
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,722
Plus, with everything
going on out there,

69
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,357
we don't think you
should go home anyway.

70
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,661
I'm not going home. I
need to see my family.

71
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,663
They're in one of our safe houses, Dom.

72
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,266
SO-4's watching them, 24/7 rotation.

73
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,301
I need to see them for myself.

74
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,270
Have already issued a joint
statement on the matter.

75
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,939
Um... that can't happen.

76
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,605
The heck is that supposed to mean?

77
00:02:56,607 --> 00:03:00,145
They're my family. I
should be able to see them.

78
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,481
It's like I said.
Until OPR clears you...

79
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,549
I'm not cleared?

80
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,852
World Bank, WTO, and
the US Federal Reserve

81
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,355
are still trying to
piece together the events.

82
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,991
Reports continue to come
in from around the globe

83
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,726
of the far reaching cyber heist.

84
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:15,760
I can't believe this.

85
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,195
The confirmed victims of the robbery

86
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,031
include prominent businessmen, CEOs...

87
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,669
You don't trust me to know
where my own family is?

88
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,701
Not now, no.

89
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:28,273
Officials believe the
compromised Deus Group

90
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,509
accounts were managed
by Cyprus National Bank.

91
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,079
They're thought to be at
the center of the hack.

92
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,248
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

93
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
All you need to worry about right now

94
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,518
is getting a good night's sleep.

95
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,587
This hospital's gonna
take great care of you.

96
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,291
Now make sure she gets
whatever she needs.

97
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:47,592
Deus Group lost trillions
of dollars in cyber-attacks.

98
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,261
Law enforcement
authorities suspect fsociety

99
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,930
to be the architects of the heist...

100
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,765
Can I get you anything before I go?

101
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,867
I wanna go home.

102
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,102
Pardon me?

103
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,703
I have to go home.

104
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,739
Sweetheart, it's like I said earlier,

105
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,706
the doctor isn't recommend...

106
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,641
The doctor said the surgery went great.

107
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,877
Right?

108
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,846
And I'm able to walk around just fine

109
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,548
as long as I don't tear my stitches.

110
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,954
You can't legally keep
me here if I wanna leave.

111
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,789
Yes, we can discharge you
against medical advice, but...

112
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,125
That's what I want.

113
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,931
I really appreciate this, but
I don't need this wheelchair.

114
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,920
Hospital policy, ma'am.

115
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:30,668
Did the nurse call your pickup contact?

116
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,870
What?

117
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,638
Who's picking you up?

118
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,873
Nobody's picking me up.

119
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,840
What's that?

120
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,509
Just gonna grab a cab.

121
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,477
You can't do that, ma'am.

122
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,779
Why not?

123
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,148
Since the hospital
administered anesthesia,

124
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,283
you have to have somebody with you.

125
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,453
Can't just put you in
a cab with a stranger.

126
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,790
You sure there's nobody you can call?

127
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,458
A friend, a family member...

128
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,859
No.

129
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,898
I don't have anyone.

130
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:04,169
What about one of those FBI
guys that was here earlier?

131
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,637
I could give one of them a call.

132
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,338
Definitely not.

133
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,439
All right.

134
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,709
I'm gonna check the Social
Services volunteer list

135
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,479
and see who we have available today.

136
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,481
It'll just take a sec.

137
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,483
Hang tight. I'll be back.

138
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,451
This is ridiculous... I told
you, I'm good, I'm just gonna...

139
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,153
Can I trust you to behave?

140
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,789
Or do we need to bring
security over here?

141

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

142
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,238
Open up. We don't have a lot of time.

143
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,892
What the fuck is going on here?

144
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,429
Don't worry about
that. We're not staying.

145
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,498
You shouldn't even be here.

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,599
When I...

147
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,199
It took me forever to find
what hospital you were at,

148
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,954
and when I found out you went home...

149
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,605
Want a grilled cheese sandwich?

150
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,077
Why are you even here?

151
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,012
Shouldn't you still be at the hospital?

152
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,949
Probably.

153
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,650
Figured not the safest place to be,

154
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,920
given what you guys did.

155
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,356
Saw the news, guess you
really pulled it off.

156
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,192
Which is why we need to
get the fuck out of here.

157
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,094
Elliot and I have a
getaway plan lined up,

158
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,163
and I think it'd be in your
best interest to come with us.

159
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,665
I'm not going anywhere.

160
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,302
Dom, you cannot stay here.

161
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,870
Best bet is to leave with us

162
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,872
until this whole thing blows over.

163
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,873
I have to stay here

164
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,976
until the OPR investigation
clears my name.

165
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,444
Who gives a shit about that?

166
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,445
I do.

167
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,479
Why?

168
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,282
Because then I can see my family again.

169
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,850
Then I can finally apologize to them

170
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,486
for everything I put them through.

171
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,326
Alexa, play some Faith Hill.

172
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,129
Shuffling songs by Faith Hill.

173
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,654
I can't remember the last time

174
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:31,776
I had a good grilled cheese sandwich.

175
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,378
Every day, I'd come home from work

176
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,546
and say I was gonna make myself
a grilled cheese sandwich,

177
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,881
but I was always too tired.

178
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,517

that '70s paranoia shit,

308
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,904
but I don't know, this one...
this one really spoke to me.

309
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,574
You know, maybe it was
what my boy Joubert says:

310
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,943
"I don't interest myself in the why.

311
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,946
I think more often
in terms of the when,

312
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,783
sometimes where, but always how much."

313
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,386
I fucking felt that.

314
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,954
Got me opening up my eyes

315
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,124

streams and whatnot.

316
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,527

358
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,170
You're not pretending
to be someone you're not.

359
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,911
You think Leon's my real name?

360
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,947
♪ And ours is doing nothing ♪

361
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,682
♪ But all the time we spent ♪

362
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,119

disturbance I'm creating ♪

364
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,128
♪ But you got a lot to learn
if you think I'm not... ♪

365
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,098
Where are we?

366
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,167
In the land of RWAs.

367
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,893
♪ Wait for me, oh, I ♪

368
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,238
Best you keep your eye out.

369
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,279
Jackie's a diehard for Hall & Oates.

370
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,147
She's a gym teacher.

371
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:27,318
No, she's not a gym teacher. She's a...

372
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,354
pastry chef.

373
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,759
She's got a soft spot for Nutella.

374
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,087
We ready?

375
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,859
Not yet. Leon said something
about stealing a mirror

376
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:10,361
and then went on about
how illiterate America is

377
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,956
and then said he had
to piss a bunch of red,

378
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,025
so I took that as my cue to walk away.

379
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,100
Look at all these people.

380
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,795
They're all probably
on their way back home.

381
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,297
Holidays are over.

382
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,051
It's back to the grind
for most of them, I guess.

383
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,188
It sucks.

384
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:44,000
I wanna show you something. Come on.

385
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:56,637
Should we really be out
in the open like this?

386
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,406
I don't know.

387
00:22:58,408 --> 00:23:00,743
Maybe not, but...

388
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,513
For once, I wanna drop the paranoia

389
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:05,249
and just take all this in.

390
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,318
Just for this moment.

391
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,192
What is this moment, exactly?

392
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,808
Watch this.

393
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,879
What did you just do?

394
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,185
Just give it a few seconds.

395
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,363
Darlene, you're worrying me.

396
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,319
I'm pretty good at that, aren't I?

397
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,022
- Tell me.
- Be patient.

398
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:32,082
- If you did something, I need to know.
- Oh, do you?

399
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,403
Is this something illegal again?

400
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,616
- Dom.
- I'm serious, Darlene.

401
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:36,740
- If you don't tell me what you're up to...
- Just wait.

402
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,442
What is it with you
and breaking the law?

403
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,411
It's like a fetish.

404
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,981
Shut the fuck up and just watch.

405
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,318
I don't get it.

406
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,986
What's going on?

407
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,389
All of the money
Whiterose and her cronies

408
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:29,126
have been stealing for decades
just went back to the people.

409
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,702
How?

410
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,204
We found a way to evenly
disperse it anonymously

411
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,173
into everyone's Ecoin wallets.

412
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,553
Everyone got this much?

413
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,221
Yep.

414
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,290
And due to E Corp's insistence

415
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,960
that Ecoin remain independent
from the US dollar,

416
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,162
it is completely impossible

417
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,731
for them to reverse the transactions.

418
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,538
This is illegal. This is stealing.

419
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,907
After what the Dark Army did to you?

420
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,376
Fuck, after what they did to everyone,

421
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,115
you really wanna start defending them?

422
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:23,438
This isn't what justice
is supposed to look like.

423
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,040
We have laws for a reason.

424
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,307
And they were so powerful,

425
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:29,286
they wrote the laws
to benefit themselves.

426
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,189
They got away with everything
because they banked on us,

427
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,858
all of us, to trust the system.

428
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,229
That was our vulnerability,
and they took advantage of it.

429
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,343
It took this to finally stop them,

430
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:43,667
and you were a part of it.

431
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,802
Look around.

432
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,204
This is it.

433
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:57,414
Everything we've been through
led up to this one moment...

434
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:01,551
The greatest redistribution
of wealth in history.

435
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:10,127
We just Robin Hooded
those evil motherfuckers.

436
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,865
If you ask me, this is exactly
what justice looks like.

437
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,271
Whoo!

438
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,209
Whoo!

439
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,777
Whoo!

440
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,817
People are staring at you.

441
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,685
I don't care!

442
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,455
Fuck yeah, bitches!

443
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:10,887
May I have your attention, please.

444
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,392
This area is for loading
and unloading only.

445
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,595
Vehicles must be attended at all times.

446
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,964
For security reasons...

447
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,230
Hey, make sure you check
out that Sydney Pollack joint

448
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:25,569
when you get a chance.

449
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,639
Thank me later, Jackie.

450
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,379
So...

451
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,817
Did you keep any of it?

452
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,654
Keep what?

453
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:48,692
Covert. That's cool.

454
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,926
I'm saying, though,

455
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,896
if you're looking to get into
some shit when you get back,

456
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,698
I got some shit for you.

457
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,299
Like what?

458
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,935
Adventures and whatnot.

459
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,038
You know, a high like this...

460
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,474
it don't come so easy with the normies.

461
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,310
Thanks, dude, but, uh,

462
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,546
I'm trying to lay low for a bit.

463
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,791
No doubt.

464
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:13,583
But with skills like
yours, the pay is good,

465
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,119
and you get to be your
own boss, 'cause you know,

466
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,090
you a boss, girl.

467
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:24,494
Let me think about it.

468
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,062
Cool.

469
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,134
Till the next episode, then.

470
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:33,770
Vehicles must be attended at all times.

471
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,942
For security reasons,
unattended vehicles...

472
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,713
You should not accept offers
of transportation from anyone

473
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,482
without prior arrangement.

474
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,908
Dom?

475
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,947
How the hell are you?

476
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,584
Hey, you coming over
here to pick up a copy?

477
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,986
Hey, they're great for long flights.

478
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,688
A real page turner,

479
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,175
especially when you get to the part

480
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:30,193
where he strangles his
mother to death in Chapter 12.

481
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,697
Spoiler alert!

482
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:37,167
You know, today's your lucky day.

483
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,736
I'm gonna sign you a copy.

484
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,345
Here you go.

485
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,515
Aw, come on.

486
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:57,167
Yeah, the book's flying off the shelves.

487
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:58,503
It's a real stocking stuffer.

488
00:30:58,505 --> 00:30:59,689
In fact, that's what I'm doing here.

489
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,949
I got a little book tour stop at UMass.

490
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,129
Anyway, how have you been?

491
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,708
Is that Elliot's sister?

492
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,378
You two a thing now, or...

493
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,448
I knew I picked up on something.

494
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,119
Please don't hurt us.

495
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,987
Hurt you?

496
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,924
Why would I hurt you?

497
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,227
Because I...

498
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,164
I disobeyed orders,
I... I killed my handler.

499
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,848
Oh, she was a pain in the ass.

500
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,369
Trust me, you were doing them a favor.

501
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,673
And... and your little
loudmouth friend over there,

502
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,942
yeah, well, what she did
was a bad thing, but...

503
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,145
Well, word around camp is

504
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,649
they don't care about you two no more.

505
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,319
What do you mean?

506
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,254
They've picked up and skedaddled off

507
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,723
to something more important.

508
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,325
Where?

509
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,994
That I can't tell you.

510
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:15,565
But all those things you said
you were gonna do to my family.

511
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,636
No one cares about your family now.

512
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,605
Look, I'm telling you, the
Dark Army's not something

513
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,275
you need to worry about anymore.

514
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,278
Look, if they wanted to get to you two,

515
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,612
I would know about it.

516
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,682
Trust me.

517
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,784
But... But I...

518
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,690
I saw you butcher Santiago with
an axe when he got out of line.

519
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,727
Yeah.

520
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,297
That was fun.

521
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,767
All right, well,

522
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,136
this was nice.

523
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,738
I'm gonna go.

524
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,107
Make sure you pay for that.

525
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:00,946
She still needs to pay for that.

526
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:08,151
Take it easy, Dom.

527
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:20,697
Just wanted me to buy one of his books.

528
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,532
And you did?

529
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,568
The cashier made me
because he autographed it.

530
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:32,675
He actually said they
don't care anymore.

531
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,611
Yep.

532
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,613
I don't get it.

533
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:39,449
Where did the Dark Army go?

534
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,252
I don't know, he wouldn't tell me.

535
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,558
All I know is we don't
have to run anymore.

536
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,337
Yeah, but we're here.

537
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,845
Might as well still go.

538
00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:06,543
I've heard Budapest is pretty dope.

539
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,915
Why Budapest anyway?

540
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:19,656
Cisco always talked about going there,

541
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:23,827
but once what happened, happened

542
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,796
I just couldn't go by myself.

543
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,920
Globe Airlines flight 4057 to Budapest

544
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:37,106
will begin boarding at Gate B31.

545
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,409
That's us. We should get going.

546
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,454
Where's your brother?

547
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,891
He's not coming with us.

548
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:58,361
Why not?

549
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,463
He's running behind.

550
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,899
He's gonna catch the next flight out.

551
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,301
Let's go.

552
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,538
Wait.

553
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,446
I can't do this.

554
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,722
Can't do what?

555
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,644
You convinced me to come

556
00:35:27,646 --> 00:35:30,159
because the Dark Army was a threat.

557
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,662
Now they're not.

558
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,465
Doesn't mean we still can't go.

559
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,502
Do you even really want
to go to Budapest anyway?

560
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:44,173
You said it yourself, this
was Cisco's dream, not yours.

561
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,377
Then, we won't go there.

562
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,246
When we land, we'll hitch
a ride to somewhere else.

563
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,784
Just come with me.

564
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:55,385
Darlene.

565
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,120

This isn't about Budapest.

591
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,054
You leave this airport,

592
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:42,825
you're just gonna go back to
the grind like everyone else.

593
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:47,096
I'm talking about
giving yourself a break.

594
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,415
Okay? About finally letting go.

595
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:53,645
Global Airlines flight 4057 to Budapest

596
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:56,108
will begin boarding at Gate B31.

597
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,958
Send me a postcard, okay?

598
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,972
One other thing.

599
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,281
I wrote down the number
of a friend of mine.

600
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,616
He works at US Cyber Command.

601
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:46,823
Your bright idea is
for me to be some pig?

602
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,759
When you're ready to grow up.

603
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't take too long, though.

604
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:00,238
They need you.

605
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,879
They can't handle me.

606
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:52,188
Welcome, ladies and gentleman,

607
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,458
to Global Airlines
flight 4057 to Budapest.

608
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,226
Boarding will begin shortly.

609
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,095
First we would like to
invite any passengers

610
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,130
that need extra time or assistance...

611
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,000
you now will come
aboard through gate B31.

612
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,454
We are now boarding all passengers

613
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:43,801
in group A and group B.

614
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:08,731
Ladies and gentleman,

615
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:12,268
group C, you are welcome
to board for flight 4057.

616
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:30,446
Excuse me, are you okay?

617
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,822
Everyone, please take your seats

618
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:36,423
and fasten your seatbelts.

619
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:38,742
We will be closing
the cabin doors shortly

620
00:42:38,744 --> 00:42:41,345
in preparation for takeoff.

621
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,640
Ma'am?

622
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:01,610
Are you okay? Is there
something I can help you with?

623
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,457
Are you missing something?

624
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,820
No, I'm good.

625
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,343
Do you need any help?

626
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,215
No.

627
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:48,486
No.

628
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:55,698
No, thanks, I'm okay.

629
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,561
Final call for flight 4057 to Budapest.

630
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:02,966
Final call for flight 4057 to Budapest.

631
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,879
That your flight they just called?

632
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,716
Yeah.

633
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,274
Yeah, but I'm not going.

634
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:20,872
Are you sure? I can get someone.

635
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:23,692
No.

636
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,766
No, I've got it.

637
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,591
I can take care of myself.

638
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:47,450
Have your seat backs in an
upright position for takeoff.

639
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,070
Thank you.
